<h1>Iframes</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to the explaination of iframes on a google extention.
   For iframes you need some things: The iframe element in html, and a site that gives you the allowence to use an iframe.
</p>

<iframe src="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=translate&ia=web"></iframe>

<p>Above here, you see an iframe with an error in it, this is because only some websites allow iframes. 
  Thats why iframes are in some sittuations hard to use.
  But ofcours, with alot of sites: We can make it happen.
